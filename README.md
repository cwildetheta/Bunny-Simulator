The code written for the Bunny Simulator project.

The code in the main meets all of the core requirements of the project, using a list of shared pointers pointing to bunny objects.
The bunnies can age, die, breed, spread an infection, and be culled, both automatically and by user input.
The code outputs a list of the bunnies each turn, sorted by age, as well as notifications for bunny births, deaths and cullings.
The code has been written to be as concise, robust, and efficient as possible, ensuring full randomness where appropriate.

Additional features are contained in branches. At present, the only active branch contains code which outputs data generated in the project to a file.
